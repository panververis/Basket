Butter, Milk and Bread Basket!

Simple, Clean and Well Tested customer basket, enabling a customer to buy butter, milk and bread!

Allows a customer to add items in the basket, and returns the final total price with the following promos applied (if they are applicable of course)

Available Products and Prices:
Butter 0.80 pounds
Milk   1.15 pounds
Bread  1.00 pounds

Available Promos:
Buying two butters, you can get a bread at 50% off
Buying three milks, you can get a fourth one for free.

(Testing scenarios included in the project's Unit Test)

TDD was followed ==> First write the Unit Test, THEN write actual code.
(Pretty good exercise actually for developing your TDD skills, it's a good TDD kata)
The above process can be clearly seen in the commits in the Repo.
Only master branch included (no reason for extra branches in such a small project)

(I am now hungry btw, craving cookies with milk and bread slices with butter and honey.)
